# Overview

This example code contains implementation of several features:

- Language CRUD module (Admin app + GraphQL API)
- Page Translation Editor with live preview (Admin app)
- Translation injection into the page content (Website app)

# Prerequisites

Upgrade your `5.40.x` project to `5.41.0-dbt.0` (the `dbt` NPM tag) by running the following command:

```
yarn up "@webiny/*@dbt"
```

> NOTE: if your project is on an even older version, like 5.39.x, you will have to upgrade to 5.40.x first, by following the [5.40.5 upgrade guide](https://www.webiny.com/docs/release-notes/5.40.5/upgrade-guide).

# Installation

> EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE: please note that this code is only applicable to an experimental release published under the `dbt` NPM tag, until the official `5.41.0` is available.
